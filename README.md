# ⚙️ Advanced Redstone Limiter

A modular, high-performance plugin designed to manage redstone activity on your Minecraft server. Prevent lag, enhance server stability, and fine-tune redstone mechanics with precision. Normal redstone auto-mated builds like gold farm, iron farm, etc will still work.
